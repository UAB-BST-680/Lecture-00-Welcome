# On feelings

Learning how to program can be frustrating.

- You might feel like you are a 'bad' programmer.

- You might feel like you can't contribute to a team.

- It's okay to have feelings like this. 

- I have them too.

# Getting help

- This class is designed to challenge you

- Struggling is normal, and is in no way an indication that you don't belong.

- Talk with me if you feel overwhelmed by the coursework.

- Talk with other students (they feel overwhelmed too).

- Post R related problems on our community github repository

- Communicate any non-R related problems to me by e-mail.

- I want to be a safe and helpful resource for you.
